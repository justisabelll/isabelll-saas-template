AI Prompt to Generate Example Blog Posts (Please dont use this for real blog posts)

Prompt: 
Create a Markdown (mdx) article focused on a random technology-related topic.
It should have all of the following elements:
- A title
- A subtitle
- Other subheadings
- A list of at least 5 items
- Code blocks
- A link to an external source
- An image (use one that you know is available in the assets folder)


Frontmatter Schema:
---
title: ''
excerpt: ''
image: ''
publishedAt: ''
author: ''
ogImage:
  url: ''
---

Ensure that you maintain the existing front matter schema. 
For the image path, begin with '/assets/blog/default-gradients/'. 
Here, you will need to select an image file that matches the naming convention already in place. 
This consists of a two-digit number ranging from '01' to '15', 
representing the sequence of available gradients.
 Concatenate this number directly with the '.webp' file extension to complete the image path.
